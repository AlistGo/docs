### Single sign-on client id

### Single sign-on client secrets

secrets ID



::: warning matters needing attention

1. Remember to write and save the background parameters of AList. After writing and saving, you have to go back to the bottom of the personal data and there will be a button that needs to be bound, otherwise it cannot be used

2. Only one of the four types of single sign-on can be enabled temporarily. If you used other single sign-on methods before and then changed to a new single Unbind (just one click) and then bind the single sign-on method you want to use now.

3. If you use **`GitHub,Microsoft,Google,DingTalk`**, you only need to fill in the client ID and secret key, and select the corresponding platform in the options.

   - If you use **`Casdoor`** the following parameters need to be filled in, just follow the tutorial to fill in

After filling it out, we click `Certificate and Password` on the left column to create a new `Client Password` to get our client secret key

- After the client password is created, the **`value`** parameter is our `client key`, remember to save it, it will not appear again if it appears once, if you don’t save it in time, just create a new client password

The client ID is in `Overview` at the top of the left column, find the application (client) ID, which is the client ID we need to fill in the Alist

- We have got the client ID and secret key and fill them in the AList single sign-on configuration.

@tab Casdoor

What is `Cadoor`? Yes, you can use other OAuth applications to log in. [**Self-deployment**](https://casdoor.org/docs/basic/server-installation) is open source and free, and official hosting requires payment.

Now, Casdoor supports many OAuth application providers, as many as dozens of kinds, you have seen and not seen

**GitHub open source link: https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor**

-----

After we enter `Casdoor`, we first create **Organization**^1^, **Token**^2^, **Application**^3^, **User**^4^

Then fill in the `AList` backstage single sign-on option one by one. The user’s parameters are ignored for the time being. They are filled in when the personal data is bound to the single sign-on.

![sso](/img/advanced/casdoor.png)

After filling in the above parameters, we come to the personal data and click `Bind point single sign-on platform` to bind

Then the `Casdoor` window will pop up, we can enter our registered user name
