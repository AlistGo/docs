# IPA install



## **1. IPA native installation**

You can directly upload the ipa file. 

But for **ios>=16**, you need to name the ipa file: `original file name@bundle-identifier.ipa`, that is, you need to add `@bundle-identifier` on the original basis, in which `bundle-identifier` is the `CFBundleIdentifier` of Info.plist in the IPA package. Such as:

- aszs@rn.notes.best.ipa

Recommended to use [ipa-renamer](https://github.com/Xhofe/ipa-renamer) to rename your ipa files automatically and quickly.

- If you are a mobile phone user, you can also rename the IPA file, but you must know the format mentioned above, but there is no mobile phone renaming software, please solve it yourself...

### **Tips**

-  ==.ipa installation requires https and a valid certificate== , not just a package can be installed without a signature

### **other instructions**

1. If you click the **TrollStore** button to open Apple's magnifying glass, it is because of the following reasons

    - Your `TrollStore` version number is less than version 1.3+, it is recommended to update to the latest version directly
    - Your URL scheme is not enabled. If you enable it, remember to click the first option to log out immediately **(Rebuild Now)**
      - ![TrollStore](/img/advanced/TrollStore.jpg)
