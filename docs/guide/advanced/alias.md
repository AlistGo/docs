# alias

What are `alias`? `alias` is a function for path merging

Except **`download preview (read-only)`** operations ^(copy, delete, rename, offline download, upload)^ are not allowed

For example: cloud disk account 1 and cloud disk account 2 both have the folder `Movies`, but the contents may not (all) overlap

**`Previously (virtual path)`**: can only be mounted to two different paths (cloud disk 1/movie, cloud disk 2/movie) or (movie\cloud disk 1, movie\cloud disk 2 )
**`Now(alias)`**: Provide an aggregated folder (movie) which can contain the contents of cloud disk 1 and cloud disk 2 at the same time



The folder content rules when displaying are as follows
1. Merge with the same name: the same files (folders) are automatically merged into one
2. The same name is preferred: when accessing resources, the folder in the path at the top when filling in the path for each fixed access



Let me explain **`same name firstÂ²`** access rules

Example 1. Fill in the access according to the following path

```
local: /localtest/local1
local: /localtest/local2
local: /localtest/local3
local: /localtest/local4
```

- 1, if there is a video 1 2 3 4, each visit is `1`
- 2, a video 3 4 yes then every visit is `3`

Example 2. Fill in the access according to the following path

```
local: /localtest/local4
local: /localtest/local3
local: /localtest/local2
local: /localtest/local1
```

- 1, if a video has 1 2 3 4, each visit is `4`
- 2, a video 3 4 has then every visit is `4`
