# Aliyundrive Open

:::tip

Aliyundrive Open, using the official authorization API development.

:::

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from "vue";
const minutes = ref<string|number>("unknown")
const max = ref<string|number>("unknown")
const getLimit = async ()=>{
  const resp = await fetch("https://api.nn.ci/alist/ali_open/limit")
  const res = await resp.json()
  minutes.value = res.minutes
  max.value = res.max
}
typeof fetch !== "undefined" && getLimit()
</script>

:::danger Read the precautions carefully

1.  ==The refresh token obtained by this tool can only be used for **Aliyundrive open platform** storage mount method== 
2. The token filled in when Alist is mounted should also be provided by this tool, and the previous acquisition method will not be available
3. Not applicable to others, but only for Alist
4. If the same IP requests {{ max }} times within {{ minutes }} minutes, **TooManyRequests** will appear. :no_entry_sign:So please do not abuse:no_entry_sign:
    - For example, a request is counted when saving/editing, and viewing a file or watching a video download is not counted.

:::

![file_id](/img/drivers/aliyundrive.png)



### Client id，Client secret

Normal users don’t need to fill in the blank. If they apply for official authorization, they can also use their own to fill in. If it is blank, the default is to use the one provided by Alist.



## Remove way

- Trash: Enter the cloud disk recycle bin after AList is deleted, which will occupy the cloud disk space, but it can be retrieved if it is deleted by mistake later.
- Delete: Direct deletion will not stay in the recycle bin and will not take up cloud disk space, but if it is deleted by mistake later, it cannot be retrieved.
  - Note: Please do not disclose the Token obtained by your Alibaba cloud disk Open. If you accidentally leak it, please immediately go to [**Other instructions ¹**](#Open%20Alibaba%20Cloud%20Disk%20APP%20-->%20My%20-->%20Settings%20gear%20in%20the%20upper%20right%20corner%20-->%20Privacy%20Settings%20-->%20Authorization%20Management%20-->%20Click%20AList%20to%20view) to deauthorize to protect the security of your account. After 2 hours after deauthorization (recommended more Wait a few hours before authorizing to obtain Token)




## other instructions

one、

> AList only obtained cloud disk users (**name avatar¹**), (**access file permission²**) and (**write file permission³**), and did not obtain mobile phone number permission
>
> Details can be viewed in two ways:
>
> 1. **Prompt** when scanning the QR code to obtain the refresh token
> 2. ###### Open **Alibaba Cloud Disk APP --> My --> Settings gear in the upper right corner --> Privacy Settings --> Authorization Management --> Click AList** to view
>     
>     - If you don't use it, you can manually cancel the permission at any time

two、

>By default, the built-in player of Aliyun Disk is used - **Aliyun Video Previewer**
>
>The video uploaded to the cloud disk will be converted into an H.264 encoded video stream through the transcoding service. (The good thing is that IOS can play... well, it should be like this)
>
>- For videos newly uploaded to the cloud disk, only the first 30s of the video are pre-transcoded by default. Full video transcoding is triggered on first playback. The transcoded video will be cached, and re-transcoding is not required to trigger playback again.
>- Videos shorter than 30s will not trigger pre-transcoding, and will only start transcoding when they are played for the first time.
>- Real-time transcoding takes some time.
>- The picture quality are: LD|SD|HD|FHD|QHD
