# Baidu Netdisk

:::tip
Due to the limitation of Baidu Disk API, downloading files larger than about 20M needs to carry the header: "User-Agent": "pan.baidu.com", so when downloading files larger than 20M, you need to set the request header yourself, such as using curl:
```bash
curl -L -X GET 'YOUR_LINK' -H 'User-Agent: pan.baidu.com'
```
Or use the proxy function in this program to transfer.

### Root folder path
The root foler to mount, defaults to `/`, same as local storage.

### Download api
- official: The official interface, very stable, but for larger files, UA needs to be modified and the speed is slow
- crack: unofficial interface, no need to modify UA and some files may not limit the speed, but **maybe** unstable

The premise is that you need to have a member. It will only be useful if you have a member who has changed `UA` (choose official and 302). It can only help you here
