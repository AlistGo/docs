Because there are no related equipment and services, it is impossible to test. You can test it yourself according to the method provided in the **`GitHub Discussions`** discussion

**https://github.com/alist-org/alist/discussions/2215#discussioncomment-4104018**



Wait for the more detailed tutorials to be supplemented after the relevant equipment or services are available, or wait for the PR of the boss who has no problem with the test.
