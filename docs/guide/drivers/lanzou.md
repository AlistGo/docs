# LanZou Cloud

There are two **modes (types)** of Lanzuo network disk mount, respectively **cookie** and **link**

- cookie: All files in the network disk can be displayed, but the cookie of the network disk needs to be provided
- Link: only display the content in the link (you can mount it without providing a cookie)



⚠It is recommended to use the **cookie** method to mount. Using the link mode will always cause convulsions. I don’t know what’s going on and suddenly prompts: **failed get objs:failed to list objs: not find data**



## **refresh token**

Log in to your [**Lanzuo Cloud Disk**](https://pc.woozooo.com/) account, then F12 to open the developer mode, you can find `Cookie`, there is no specific one, such as the left side of the picture Just click one and there will be `Cookie` in the blue part of the right picture.

## **root folder ID**

Lanzuo cloud disk root directory ID, the default is `-1`

- **Additional Folder ID**
   - Two ways to obtain (see the picture below)
   - <img src="/img/drivers/lanzou/lanzou2.gif" alt="LanZou folder_id" style="zoom:50%;" />

## **Share link and share password**

- **Share link**: Randomly generate a share link in the Lanzuo cloud disk
   - Small tip: **lanzouX** in the link, the last default **X** content sometimes cannot be opened in some areas, you can try to change it yourself, for example, change to i, x, u, t, etc. Anyway, try it out for yourself.
- **Share password**: the password for the link



## **Repair file info**

If you need **WebDav** service, you need to open it



## **Mount and fill in the example**
