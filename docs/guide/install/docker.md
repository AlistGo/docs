# Use Docker

See the log output for the admin's info:
```bash
docker exec -it alist ./alist admin
```

### Release version

#### docker-cli

```bash
docker run -d --restart=always -v /etc/alist:/opt/alist/data -p 5244:5244 -e PUID=0 -e PGID=0 -e UMASK=022 --name="alist" xhofe/alist:latest
```

#### docker-compose

```yaml
version: '3.3'
services:
    alist:
        restart: always
        volumes:
            - '/etc/alist:/opt/alist/data'
        ports:
            - '5244:5244'
        environment:
            - PUID=0
            - PGID=0
            - UMASK=022
        container_name: alist
        image: 'xhofe/alist:latest'
```

### Offline download with aria2

If you want to use aria2 to offline download, we recommend you to use this [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/xhofe/alist-aria2), which carries a pre-installed aria2.

### Dev version
Just for amd64/arm64. Not recommended, this may can't work properly. 

#### docker-cli

```bash
docker run -d --restart=always -v /etc/alist:/opt/alist/data -p 5244:5244 -e PUID=0 -e PGID=0 -e UMASK=022 --name="alist" xhofe/alist:main
```

#### docker-compose

```yaml
version: '3.3'
services:
    alist:
        restart: always
        volumes:
            - '/etc/alist:/opt/alist/data'
        ports:
            - '5244:5244'
        environment:
            - PUID=0
            - PGID=0
            - UMASK=022
        container_name: alist
        image: 'xhofe/alist:main'
```

### Specify version
See https://hub.docker.com/r/xhofe/alist for details

### User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

### Additional notes about the offline download feature

If the image is not pulled using the '''docker pull --platform''' parameter, docker may pull the 32-bit image on the 64-bit operating system, which may cause the offline download function to be unavailable even under normal configuration.

When an error occurs, you will see a similar error log in Alist's log file.

```ERRO[2022-11-20 12:05:19] error [unaligned 64-bit atomic operation] while run task  [download http://pic.rmb.bdstatic.com/bjh/34ee946f7a74435a167ca4351d723374.png to [/ftp](/)]```

Solution, if the CPU architecture is 64-bit, try to manually pull the 64-bit docker image, rebuild the container, and try again.

If the CPU architecture is 32-bit, there is currently no solution available.



### How to update Docker installation?

::: details docker-cli
1. docker ps -a #View the container (find the ID of the Alist container)
2. docker stop ID #Stop Alist running, otherwise it cannot be deleted (this time the ID of the Alist container is d429749a6e69, it is different for each installation)
3. docker rm ID #Delete the Alist container (the data is still there as long as you don't delete it manually)
4. docker pull xhofe/alist:latest
5. [Enter the installation command and click to view](#docker-cli)
6. The update is complete, go and have a look.. It's that simple

**There is a missing step in the picture, it is step 4 in the tutorial....remember to execute**

1. docker-compose pull
2. docker-compose up -d

Q: My version is v3.x.x and I cannot upgrade to the latest version. docker pull xhofe/alist:latest does not work to pull the latest version. After changing to docker-compose, it is still version 3.x.x

A: The reason is that your docker has set up a mirror, and the latest version cannot be updated from the mirror, so modify /etc/docker/daemon.json and delete "registry-mirrors": ["mirror accelerator address"]
